# eFOV_microendoscopes_sim
Simulations code for Antonini et al, 2020, bioRxiv

This code generates artificial time series from synthetic data. It randomly places somas in a given volumes and simulates their spiking activity. Then, simulates the imaging of the artificial volume with two different types of endoscopes, one without correction for aberrations and one with aberration correction.
